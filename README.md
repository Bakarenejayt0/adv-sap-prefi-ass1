## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- SOA allows everything to run through a single interface. That means you can reuse code. You do not have to worry about making new code and costing company money.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- _Standardized Service Contracts:_ an agreement between parties where one party sets the terms.
- _Loose Coupling:_ reducing dependencies between different systems.
- _Abstraction:_ Hiding design details and implementation logic from the outside world
- _Service Reusability:_ means it have an intention on maximizing reuse.
- _Autonomy:_ A service should be self-contained.
- _Statelessness:_ The use of document-style messages.
- _Discoverability:_ provide a discovery mechanism, such as a service registrt or directory.
- _Composability:_ creating new service while combining existing services.
- _Interoperability:_ allows different distributed web services to run on a variety of software platforms and hardware architectures.
3. Define Microservices.
- It divides SOA service into a smaller services.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- _Independently Deployable:_ it enables the organization to create small, cross-functional teams around one service.
- _Right tool for the job:_ Each service can use its own language, framework, or ancillary services while still being able to communicate easily with the other service in the application.
- _Precise Scaling:_ Each microservice operates as an independent entity with its own boundaries and responsibilities.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- they both allow development teams to build, deploy, and manage modern applications efficiently for cloud environments, mean while their difference is SOA model, are shared and reused enterprise-wide, while microservice is built on individual services that function independently.
